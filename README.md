# The best article for you on IBM Watson Studio
## Building recommendation engines
==============
# Overview
This project uses user interaction to provide article recommendations on [IBM Watson Studio](https://www.ibm.com/blog/tag/ibm-watson-studio/)

# Outline of the notebook
In this project we create two types of recommendation engines: a rank-based recommendation engine and a user-user based collaborative filtering.

Here is the table of content:

- I. Exploratory Data Analysis
- II. Rank Based Recommendations
- III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
- IV. Matrix Factorization

# Repository Files to be used
## Data
In data/ you will find two csv files containing a list of anonymized users and the articles they interacted with (user-item-interactions.csv) and a table of all articles and their article ids (articles_community.csv).

## Analysis
You can view the project either using the ipynb or the html file.



# Future Implementation
I plan to create python modules for a recommendation engine based on the Jupyter Notebook
